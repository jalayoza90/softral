<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial 
websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach 
stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the 
United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites 
collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers
to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being
shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: 
http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
<p><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p>
<p>Users can visit our site anonymously</p>
<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our 
home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering 
our website.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
<p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
<ul><li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li></ul>
<p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
<ul><li>By emailing us</li><li>By logging in to their account</li><li>By chatting with us or sending us a ticket</li></ul>
<p><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></p>
<p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use

<p><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts 
parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer 
protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what 
operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's 
privacy and safety online.</p>
<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of 
privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have 
played a significant role in the development of data protection laws 
around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles
and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the 
various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
<p>We will notify the users via email</p>
<ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul>
<p>We will notify the users via in site notification</p>
<ul><li>Within 7 business days</li></ul>
<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires 
that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights 
against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. 
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable 
rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to 
courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute 
non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, 
establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the 
right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out 
tough penalties for violations.</p>
<p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li><li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li><li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li><li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</li></ul>
